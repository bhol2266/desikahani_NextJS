                    We take security measures (including physical, electronic, and
                    procedural measures) to protect your Personal Data from disclosure and
                    unauthorized access. For example, only authorized employees are
                    allowed to have access to the Personal Information of our users, and
                    they can do this only for authorized business functions. In addition
                    to this, we use encryption while transferring your Personal
                    Information between your system and ours, and we use firewalls to help
                    prevent unauthorized persons from accessing your personal information.
                    However, keep in mind that we can not completely eliminate the
                    security risks associated with the storage and transfer of personal
